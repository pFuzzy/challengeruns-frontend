# Challengeruns-backend
This project is a community page for people interested in completing challenge runs.
This repository contains the frontend of the project.
# What are challenge runs?
- Extremely difficult single player games made even harder
- There are several cathegories and routes, the most well known are no-hit runs (completing the game without taking a single hit from any enemies)
  and no-damage runs (completing the game without taking any damage from any source)
# Visions of the project
- Every user can look up detailed information and tutorial about the different kind of challenge runs available for different games
- Every user can use a split manager, try to complete runs and track their progress with the help of the site
- Users have a page where they can suggest games, cathegories and routes to be added and admins can review suggestions
- Track every user's progress on every attempt they made on a run
- After completing a run upload a video of the run for verification. Once it's verified by admins their success is seen on leaderboards
- Users can communicate about games and runs on a forum page
